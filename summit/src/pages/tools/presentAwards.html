    <p>Welcome to the Awards Presentation page. Here, you can manage the presentation of awards to youth members. Please
        note that marking an award as 'Presented' here signifies that the award has actually been handed over to the youth
        member. This is different from the 'Awarded' status, which indicates that the member has earned the award but may
        not have received it yet. Remember to <b>save your changes</b> after presenting awards to ensure the information is
        updated correctly.</p>
