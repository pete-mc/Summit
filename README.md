## OAS Report

This report will give you a nice summary of the OAS levels each youth member is at and the related streams. This is a nice one pager to help you see where all the members of your unit are up to.

## Bulk Calendar Entry Form

This is to help you submit a full term or more of activities to your plan. It simplifies the process by only asking the basic questions and you can enter many on a single page.

## Export events to your own calendar

Sick of adding events in Terrain and also your own calendar. Use the shiny new button contained in a planned activity and you will recieve a ical file ready to be imported into whichever calendar application you use.
